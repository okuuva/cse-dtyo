\begin{itemize}

\item Can Linux loadable kernel modules be identified from the firmware image binary using same or
    similar signature extracting method that is beign used for kernel recognition?

\item Can static binary analysis be used in detecting what included kernel modules are loaded in runtime?

\item Can improved granularity in Linux kernel recognition be used in reducing false positives in
    vulnerability reporting?

\end{itemize}
