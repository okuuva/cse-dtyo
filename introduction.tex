\section{Background and motivation}

Modern software development isn't about writing everything from scratch, it's more about selecting
the right ready-made pieces and gluing them together. As the use of open-source software (OSS) is
on a steady rise even in the proprietary software products \cite{deshpande2008total}, the attack
surface of the programs has too increased from the in-house code to the third-party components.

Linux is by far the most widely used operating system (OS) in the world \cite{blah}. It is used
everywhere from tiniest embedded systems \cite{picotux} to the biggest super computers
\cite{top500linuxshare}. It also contains a notable number of known vulnerabilities
\cite{cvedetailslinuxkernel}, holding at the time of writing the somewhat questionable title of the
most vulnerable product according to CVE Details \cite{cvedetailstop50}. However, many of the
reported vulnerabilities actually affect some drivers, network stack or filesystem handlers instead
of the kernel core itself. These subcomponents of the kernel are usually packed as kernel modules
(LKM) \cite{blah}, meaning that all vulnerabilities incorrectly reported for the kernel are invalid
if the system doesn't contain the actual vulnerable modules.

Should I have third paragraph here? And if so what would it be about?
