\section{Software Composition Analysis}

Software composition analysis has steadily raised its profile over the years \cite{sauce}. While it
still hasn't quite reached a mainstream status yet, it has been made available for the masses by
actors such as Docker with the introduction of Docker Security Scan in Docker Hub and Docker Cloud
hosting services \cite{dockerscan}.

Here be some academics.

There are multiple commercial SCA solutions available from providers such as Black Duck
\cite{sauce}, Veracode \cite{sauce}, WhiteHat security \cite{sauce}, Whitesource \cite{sauce} and
Synopsys \cite{sauce}. The main purpose of these products is to report license information and
known vulnerabilities of the identified third party libraries from the system under test. There
are multiple different ways to identify the third party components. One common way is to statically
analyse build files from the source code repository and deduce what third party libraries are
included when the project is compiled. Another way is to try to figure out what third party
library the analyzed code belongs to.

\subsection{Static Binary Analysis}

Static binary analysis is conducted by analyzing the compiled binary without actually executing it.
