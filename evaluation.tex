\section{Evaluation outline}

The evaluation utilizes a set of compiled Linux LKMs and several Linux based firmware images. The
LKM binaries are used in the learning phase to teach the unique signatures of each module to the
scanner. The firmware images with known kernel configuration are then scanned to test the detection
rate of the new signatures.

Three sets of results are gathered. First only the modules in the firmwares are taught to the
scanner and the firmwares are scanned. Looking at the results we can determine whether the small
footprint of the modules is enough to generate viable signatures that can be reliably detected from
the firmware binaries.

In the second phase the same firmwares are compiled for different processor architecture and
scanned in order to see if the signatures are platform independent.

In the third phase involves mass teaching of different modules and rescanning the firmwares to see
if the added number of signatures reduce the size of unique signatures so much that the scan
results become unreliable due to grow number of false positives and false negatives.
